/** A specific implementation of HTTP request sending logic.
  *
  * The [[send]] method '''should not''' be used directly by client code, if possible. Instead, the [[Request.send]],
  * [[StreamRequest.send]], [[WebSocketRequest.send]] or [[WebSocketStreamRequest.send]] methods (depending on the type
  * of the request) should be used, providing a specific backend instance as a parameter.
  *
  * When creating an instance of a backend, one of the [[Backend]] traits should be mixed in, reflecting the effect type
  * and the `P` capabilities: [[Backend]], [[SyncBackend]], [[WebSocketBackend]], [[WebSocketSyncBackend]],
  * [[StreamBackend]], [[WebSocketStreamBackend]]. This is required in order to provide a better developer experience
  * when sending requests: the resulting type has less type parameters.
  *
  * @note
  *   Backends should try to classify known HTTP-related exceptions into one of the categories specified by
  *   [[SttpClientException]]. Other exceptions are thrown unchanged.
  * @tparam F
  *   The effect type used to represent side-effects, such as obtaining the response for a request. E.g. [[Identity]]
  *   for synchronous backends, [[scala.concurrent.Future]] for asynchronous backends.
  * @tparam P
  *   Capabilities supported by this backend, in addition to [[Effect]]. This might be `Any` (no special capabilities),
  *   subtype of [[sttp.capabilities.Streams]] (the ability to send and receive streaming bodies) or [[WebSockets]] (the
  *   ability to handle websocket requests).
