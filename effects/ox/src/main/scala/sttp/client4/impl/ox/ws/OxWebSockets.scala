/** Converts a [[SyncWebSocket]] into a pair of `Source` of server responses and a `Sink` for client requests. The
  * `Source` starts receiving frames immediately, its internal buffer size can be adjusted with an implicit
  * [[ox.channels.StageCapacity]]. Make sure that the `Source` is contiunually read. This will guarantee that
  * server-side Close signal is received and handled. If you don't want to process frames from the server, you can at
  * least handle it with a `fork { source.drain() }`.
  *
  * You don't need to manually call `ws.close()` when using this approach, this will be handled automatically
  * underneath, according to following rules:
  *   - If the request `Sink` is closed due to an upstream error, a Close frame is sent, and the `Source` with incoming
  *     responses gets completed as `Done`.
  *   - If the request `Sink` completes as `Done`, a `Close` frame is sent, and the response `Sink` keeps receiving
  *     responses until the server closes communication.
  *   - If the response `Source` is closed by a Close frome from the server or due to an error, the request Sink is
  *     closed as `Done`, which will still send all outstanding buffered frames, and then finish.
  *
  * @param ws
  *   a `SyncWebSocket` where the underlying `Sink` will send requests, and where the `Source` will pull responses from.
  * @param concatenateFragmented
  *   whether fragmented frames from the server should be concatenated into a single frame (true by default).
