# Examples by category

The sttp client repository contains a number of how-to guides. If you're missing an example for your use-case, please let us
know by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp)!

Each example is fully self-contained and can be run using [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org) (you just need
to copy the content of the file, apart from scala-cli, no additional setup is required!). Hopefully this will make
experimenting with sttp client as frictionless as possible!

Examples are tagged with the stack being used (Direct-style, cats-effect, ZIO, Future) and backend implementation
