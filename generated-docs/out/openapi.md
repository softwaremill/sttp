# OpenAPI

sttp-client [request definitions](requests/basics.md) can be automatically generated from [openapi](https://swagger.io/specification/) `.yaml` specifications using
the `scala-sttp` code generator, included in the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) project.

## Using the openapi-generator

For `scala-sttp`'s generator's configuration options refer to: [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/scala-sttp](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/scala-sttp).

### Standalone setup

This is the simplest setup which relies on calling openapi-generator manually and generating a complete sbt project from it.

First, you will need to install/download openapi-generator. Follow openapi-generator's [official documentation](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#1---installation) on how to do this.

Keep in mind that the `scala-sttp` generator is available only since v5.0.0-beta. 

Next, call the generator with the following options:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i petstore.yaml \
  --generator-name scala-sttp \
  -o samples/client/petstore/
```

### Maven managed

For maven project use plugin [openapi-generator-maven-plugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-maven-plugin)

### Sbt managed

In this setup openapi-generator is plugged into sbt project through the [sbt-openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/sbt-openapi-generator/) plugin.
Sttp requests and models are automatically generated upon compilation.

To have your openapi descriptions automatically turned into classes first define a new module in your project:

```scala
lazy val petstoreApi: Project = project
  .in(file("petstore-api"))
  .settings(
    openApiInputSpec := s"${baseDirectory.value.getPath}/petstore.yaml",
    openApiGeneratorName := "scala-sttp",
    openApiOutputDir := baseDirectory.value.name,
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "com.softwaremill.sttp.client4" %% "core" % "4.0.0-M19",
      "com.softwaremill.sttp.client4" %% "json4s" % "4.0.0-M19",
      "org.json4s" %% "json4s-jackson" % "3.6.8"
    )
  )
```

As this will generate code into `petstore-api/src` you might want to add this folder to the `.gitignore`. 

Since this plugin is still in a very early stage it requires some additional configuration.

First we need to connect generation with compilation. 
Add following line into petstore module settings:

```scala
    (compile in Compile) := ((compile in Compile) dependsOn openApiGenerate).value,
```

Now we have to attach our generated source code directory into cleaning process.
Add following line into petstore module settings:

```scala
    cleanFiles += baseDirectory.value / "src"
```

Last but not least we need to tell openapi-generator not to generate whole project but only the source files (without the sbt build file):
Add following line into petstore module settings:

```scala
    openApiIgnoreFileOverride := s"${baseDirectory.in(ThisBuild).value.getPath}/openapi-ignore-file",
```

and create `openapi-ignore-file` file in project's root directory with following content:

```
*
**/*
!**/src/main/scala/**/*
```

Final petstore module configuration:

```scala
lazy val petstoreApi: Project = project
  .in(file("petstore-api"))
  .settings(
    openApiInputSpec := s"${baseDirectory.value.getPath}/petstore.yaml",
    openApiGeneratorName := "scala-sttp",
    openApiOutputDir := baseDirectory.value.name,
    openApiIgnoreFileOverride := s"${baseDirectory.in(ThisBuild).value.getPath}/openapi-ignore-file",
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "com.softwaremill.sttp.client4" %% "core" % "4.0.0-M19",
      "com.softwaremill.sttp.client4" %% "json4s" % "4.0.0-M19",
      "org.json4s" %% "json4s-jackson" % "3.6.8"
    ),
    (compile in Compile) := ((compile in Compile) dependsOn openApiGenerate).value,
    cleanFiles += baseDirectory.value / "src"
  )
```

#### Additional notes

Although recent versions of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE come with "OpenApi Specification" plugin bundled into it, this plugin doesn't seem to support 
latest versions of generator and so, it is impossible to generate sttp bindings from it.
