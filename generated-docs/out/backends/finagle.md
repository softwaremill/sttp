# Twitter future (Finagle) backend

To use, add the following dependency to your project:

```
"com.softwaremill.sttp.client3" %% "finagle-backend" % "3.8.0"
```

Next you'll need to add an implicit value:

```scala
import sttp.client3.finagle.FinagleBackend
val backend = FinagleBackend()
```

This backend depends on [finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/), and offers an asynchronous backend, which wraps results in Twitter's `Future`.

Please note that: 

* the backend does not support `SttpBackendOptions`, that is specifying proxy settings (proxies are not implemented in http4s, see [this issue](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues/251)), as well as configuring the connect timeout 
* the backend does not support non-blocking [streaming](../requests/streaming.md) or [websockets](../websockets.md).
