# Scalaz backend

The [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) backend is **asynchronous**. Sending a request is a non-blocking, lazily-evaluated operation and results in a response wrapped in a `scalaz.concurrent.Task`. There's a transitive dependency on `scalaz-concurrent`.


## Using Armeria

To use, add the following dependency to your project:

```
"com.softwaremill.sttp.client4" %% "armeria-backend-scalaz" % "4.0.0-M19"
```

add imports:

```scala
import sttp.client4.armeria.scalaz.ArmeriaScalazBackend
```

create client:

```scala
val backend = ArmeriaScalazBackend()

// You can use the default client which reuses the connection pool of ClientFactory.ofDefault()
ArmeriaScalazBackend.usingDefaultClient()
```

or, if you'd like to instantiate the [WebClient](https://armeria.dev/docs/client-http) yourself:

```scala
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.circuitbreaker._
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.WebClient

// Fluently build Armeria WebClient with built-in decorators
val client = WebClient.builder("https://my-service.com")
             // Open circuit on 5xx server error status
             .decorator(CircuitBreakerClient.newDecorator(CircuitBreaker.ofDefaultName(),
               CircuitBreakerRule.onServerErrorStatus()))
             .build()

val backend = ArmeriaScalazBackend.usingClient(client)
```

```eval_rst
.. note:: A WebClient could fail to follow redirects if the WebClient is created with a base URI and a redirect location is a different URI.
```

This backend is build on top of [Armeria](https://armeria.dev/docs/client-http).
Armeria's [ClientFactory](https://armeria.dev/docs/client-factory) manages connections and protocol-specific properties.
Please visit [the official documentation](https://armeria.dev/docs/client-factory) to learn how to configure it.

## Streaming

This backend doesn't support non-blocking [streaming](../requests/streaming.md).

## Websockets

The backend doesn't support [websockets](../websockets.md).
