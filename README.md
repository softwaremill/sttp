# The Scala HTTP client that you always wanted!

## Welcome!

[sttp client](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp) is an open-source library which provides a clean, programmer-friendly API to describe HTTP
requests and how to handle responses. Requests are sent using one of the backends, which wrap other Scala or Java HTTP client implementations. The backends can integrate with a variety of Scala stacks, providing both synchronous and asynchronous, procedural and functional interfaces.
 
Backend implementations include ones based on [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/), [async-http-client](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client), [http4s](https://http4s.org), [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/), and HTTP clients which ship with Java. They integrate with [Akka](https://akka.io), [Monix](https://monix.io), [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2), [cats-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect), [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio). Supported Scala versions include 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 3, Scala.JS and Scala Native.

Here's a quick example of sttp client in action:
 
```scala
import sttp.client3._

val sort: Option[String] = None
val query = "http language:scala"

// the `query` parameter is automatically url-encoded
// `sort` is removed, as the value is not defined
val request = basicRequest.get(uri"https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=$query&sort=$sort")
  
val backend = HttpClientSyncBackend()
val response = request.send(backend)

// response.header(...): Option[String]
println(response.header("Content-Length")) 

// response.body: by default read into an Either[String, String] to indicate failure or success 
println(response.body)                                 
```

## Documentation

sttp (v3) documentation is available at [sttp.softwaremill.com](http://sttp.softwaremill.com).

sttp (v2) documentation is available at [sttp.softwaremill.com/en/v2](http://sttp.softwaremill.com/en/v2).

sttp (v1) documentation is available at [sttp.softwaremill.com/en/v1](https://sttp.softwaremill.com/en/v1).

scaladoc is available at [https://www.javadoc.io](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.softwaremill.sttp.client3/core_2.12/3.8.0)

## Quickstart with Ammonite

If you are an [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io) user, you can quickly start experimenting with sttp by copy-pasting the following:

```scala
import $ivy.`com.softwaremill.sttp.client3::core:3.8.0`
import sttp.client3.quick._
quickRequest.get(uri"http://httpbin.org/ip").send(backend)
```

This brings in the sttp API and a synchronous backend instance.

## Quickstart with sbt

Add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.client3" %% "core" % "3.8.0"
```

Then, import:

```scala
import sttp.client3._
```

Type `basicRequest.` and see where your IDE’s auto-complete gets you!

## Other sttp projects

sttp is a family of Scala HTTP-related projects, and currently includes:

* sttp client: this project
* [sttp tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir): Typed API descRiptions
* [sttp model](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp-model): simple HTTP model classes (used by client & tapir)
* [sttp shared](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp-shared): shared web socket, FP abstractions, capabilities and streaming code.
* [sttp apispec](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp-apispec): OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and JSON Schema models.

## Contributing

If you have a question, or hit a problem, feel free to ask on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/softwaremill/sttp)!

Or, if you encounter a bug, something is unclear in the code or documentation, don’t hesitate and open an issue on GitHub.

We are also always looking for contributions and new ideas, so if you’d like to get into the project, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp/issues), or post your own suggestions!

Note that running the default `test` task will run the tests using both the JVM and JS backends, and is likely to run out of memory.
If you'd like to run the tests using *only* the JVM backend, execute: `sbt rootJVM/test`.

### Modifying documentation

The documentation is typechecked using [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/). The sources for the documentation exist in `docs`. Don't modify the generated documentation in `generated-docs`, as these files will get overwritten!

When generating documentation, it's best to set the version to the current one, so that the generated doc files don't include modifications with the current snapshot version. 

That is, in sbt run: `set version := "3.8.0"`, before running `mdoc` in `docs`.

### Testing the Scala.JS backend

In order to run tests against JS backend you will need to install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

### Building & testing the scala-native backend

By default, sttp-native will **not** be included in the aggregate build of the root project. To include it, define the `STTP_NATIVE` environmental variable before running sbt, e.g.:

```
STTP_NATIVE=1 sbt
```

You might need to install some additional libraries, see the [scala native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/user/setup.html) documentation site. On macos, you might additionally need:

```
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.dylib /usr/local/lib/
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.dylib /usr/local/lib/
```
