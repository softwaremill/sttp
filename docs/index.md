# sttp: the Scala HTTP client you always wanted!

Welcome!

[sttp client](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp) is an open-source library which provides a clean, programmer-friendly API to describe HTTP
requests and how to handle responses. Requests are sent using one of the backends, which wrap other Scala or Java HTTP client implementations. The backends can integrate with a variety of Scala stacks, providing both synchronous and asynchronous, procedural and functional interfaces.
 
Backend implementations include ones based on [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/), [async-http-client](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client), [http4s](https://http4s.org), [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/), and HTTP clients which ship with Java. They integrate with [Akka](https://akka.io), [Monix](https://monix.io), [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2), [cats-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect), [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio). Supported Scala versions include 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 3, Scala.JS and Scala Native.

Here's a quick example of sttp client in action:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import sttp.client3._

val query = "http language:scala"
val sort: Option[String] = None

// the `query` parameter is automatically url-encoded
// `sort` is removed, as the value is not defined
val request = basicRequest.get(
  uri"https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=$query&sort=$sort")

val backend = HttpClientSyncBackend()
val response = request.send(backend)

// response.header(...): Option[String]
println(response.header("Content-Length"))

// response.body: by default read into an Either[String, String] 
// to indicate failure or success 
println(response.body)     
```
