# Server-sent events

All backends that support [streaming](../requests/streaming.md) also support [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events). Moreover, synchronous backends can also support SSE, when combined with [Ox](https://ox.softwaremill.com).

Refer to the documentation of individual backends, for more information on how to use SSE with a given backend, as well as usage examples.
